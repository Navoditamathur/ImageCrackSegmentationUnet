# ImageCrackSegmentationWaveletUnet
This repository contains a notebook to create a U-net Model with Dense Cross-level connections and self-attention mechanisms to capture the fine details as well as the context information to segment the road cracks, train, validate, and test the model with about 10,000 images with 5-fold cross-validation and early stopping, and assess the performance on test dataset using dice-coefficient, IOU and AUC
